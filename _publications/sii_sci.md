**Background:** Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the recommended treatment for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the prognostic value of systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) in early stage HCC is not discussed. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to explore the prognostic value of SII based on lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts in patients with HCC after RFA.

**Methods:** We retrospectively evaluated the prognostic value of the SII in training and validation cohorts, and then established an effective nomogram for HCC after RFA based on SII. The C-index, and area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (t-AUC) were used to evaluate the discrimination and calibration value of the nomogram.

**Results:** An optimal cut-off value for the SII of 324.55Ã—109 stratified the patients with HCC into high- and low-SII groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that SII was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Moreover, SII was an independent prognostic factor for early-stage HCC with normal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The t-AUC of the SII was higher for OS and RFS than for neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). A high preoperative SII was associated with multiple tumors, larger tumors, and higher levels of AFP. A well-discriminated and calibrated nomogram was constructed to predict the probability of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year RFS with C-indexes of 0.80, which was significantly higher than that obtained with other prognostic clinical indexes.

**Conclusions:** The SII is an independent prognostic factor affecting the survival outcomes of patients with early-stage HCC. The comprehensive nomogram based on SII presented in this study is a promising model for predicting RFS in HCC patients after RFA.

**Keywords:** Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); prognostic nomogram; radiofrequency ablation (RFA); recurrence-free survival (RFS); systemic immune-inflammation index (SII).
