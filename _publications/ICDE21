Entity linking aims to link ambiguous mentions
to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base, which is
significant and fundamental for various downstream applications, e.g., knowledge base completion, question answering, and
information extraction. While great efforts have been devoted
to this task, most of these studies follow the assumption that
large-scale labeled data is available. However, when the labeled
data is insufficient for specific domains due to labor-intensive
annotation work, the performance of existing algorithms will
suffer an intolerable decline. In this paper, we endeavor to solve
the problem of few-shot entity linking, which only requires a
minimal amount of in-domain labeled data and is more practical
in real situations. Specifically, we firstly propose a novel weak
supervision strategy to generate non-trivial synthetic entitymention pairs based on mention rewriting. Since the quality of the
synthetic data has a critical impact on effective model training,
we further design a meta-learning mechanism to assign different
weights to each synthetic entity-mention pair automatically.
Through this way, we can profoundly exploit rich and precious
semantic information to derive a well-trained entity linking
model under the few-shot setting. The experiments on real-world
datasets show that the proposed method can extensively improve
the state-of-the-art few-shot entity linking model and achieve
impressive performance when only a small amount of labeled
data is available. Moreover, we also demonstrate the outstanding
ability of the model’s transferability. Our code and models will
be open-sourced.
