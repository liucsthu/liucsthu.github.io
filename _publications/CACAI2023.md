Clinical Phenotyping is a fundamental task in clinical services, which assessments whether a patient suffers a medical condition of interest. Existing works focus on learning better patientsâ€™ representations. Recently, multi-task learning has been proposed to transfer knowledge from different tasks and achieved promising performance. However, the existing multi-task models still suffer from the serious negative transfer and slow convergence problem when multiple phenotype tasks are trained together. Meanwhile, phenotype relatedness is ignored, limiting to boost the performance of the multi-task learning for the phenotype prediction. To address these issues, we propose a private-shared multitask framework with auxiliary task selection and adaptive shared-space correction for phenotype prediction (MTL_AC). To start with, we design an auxiliary task selection method to find the most compatible phenotype task against one task by using phenotype relatedness. And then, a novel adaptive shared-space correction mechanism is proposed to address the negative transfer and slow convergence problem when two tasks are jointly trained under the private-shared multitask framework. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better on various phenotype prediction tasks.
