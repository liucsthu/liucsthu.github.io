Text-oriented clinical diagnosis inference is to predict a set of
diagnoses for a specific patient given its medical notes. Due to the great
potential of automatic diagnosis inference, machine learning methods
have began to be applied to this domain. However, existing approaches
focus on performing either labor-intensive feature engineering or sequential modeling of each medical note separately, without considering the information sharing among similar patients, which is essential for evidence based medicine, an emerging new diagnosis process. Motivated by this issue and the recently proposed graph convolutional network (GCN) for
text classification, we propose to apply GCN for the text-oriented clinical diagnosis inference task. To encode the comorbidity of diagnoses
into the GCN model and allow information sharing between patients, we
devise a coupled graph convolutional neural networks (CGCN), where
a note-dependent graph and a label-dependent graph are learned collaboratively with hyperplane projection to ensure they are in the same
semantic space. The comprehensive results on two real datasets show
that our method outperforms the state-of-art methods in text-oriented
diagnosis inference.
